# Source Inputs

![TV Source](../images/guition-esp32-p4-jc8012p4a1-tvsource.jpg)

If your speaker has a source input — such as a **TV** (soundbars like Sonos Beam or Arc with HDMI) or **Line-in** (speakers and amps like Sonos Five, Play:5, Port, or Amp with a 3.5mm/RCA input) — the controller can display now-playing info from the media player connected to that input. This feature is entirely optional — the controller works without it.

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is in **beta**. If you encounter any issues, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jtenniswood/esphome-media-player/issues).

## How it works

- **Automatic switching** — when the speaker's active source changes to "TV" or "Line-in", the UI switches to show title, artist, artwork, and progress from the media player connected to that input. When the source changes back, the UI reverts to the primary player.
- **Idle state** — when the source input's media player is idle, off, or on standby, the screen displays the source name ("TV" or "Line-in") on a black background with playback controls hidden. Controls reappear when playback starts again.
- **Routed controls** — play/pause, next, and previous are automatically sent to whichever player is active (music or source input).

## Setup

Open the settings page by visiting the device IP address directly in your browser, or go to the device in Home Assistant under **Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome** and click **Visit**. Set **Linked Media Player** to the entity ID of the media player connected to your input (e.g. `media_player.apple_tv`).

Leave this field empty to disable the feature.

## Compatibility

This feature works with any speaker that exposes a "TV" or "Line-in" source attribute and any media player entity in Home Assistant.

Tested with:

- **TV** (soundbars): Sonos Beam, Sonos Arc
- **Line-in** (speakers/amps): Sonos Five, Sonos Play:5, Sonos Amp, Sonos Port
